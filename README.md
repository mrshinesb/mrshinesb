My fun interaction with Siri:

Me: "Siri, is there a connection between the heart and music?"

Siri: "Absolutely! Your heart sets the rhythm, and music matches the beat. Coincidence? I think not!"

Me: "So, music is like the heartbeat of the universe?"

Siri: "Exactly. And just like your favorite song, it keeps going... unless you pause it. But please don’t pause your heart." 💓🎶
